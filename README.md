# IBM-Machine-Learning-with-Python

In this project, we will complete a notebook where we will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. We load a historical dataset, clean the data and apply different classification algorithm on the data. We need to use the following algorithms to build our models:

K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoass

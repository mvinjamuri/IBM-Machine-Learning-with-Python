# IBM-Machine-Learning-with-Python

In this project, we will complete a notebook where we will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. We need to use the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoass
